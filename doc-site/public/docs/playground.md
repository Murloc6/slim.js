# Try Slim.js

Slim.js is designed for gradual integration, and you can decide _how little or much_ to integrate into your existing application, or start as a greenfield project.

This simple demo shows how to easily adopt the expressive syntax into Slim.js components.

You can add Slim.js with or without language features, such as decorators or Typescript, for Javascript modules or as a global object: _Pick your preference_

### Example

This live example contains a single Slim.js component acting as a Todo-List mini application. It introduces the use of Slim.js' templating mechanism and example usages of the directives.
