# Hello, slim.js

Official website [here](http://slimjs.com)
Documentation [here](https://github.com/slimjs/slim.js/wiki)

## Slim is ultra fast, native and elegant library for web components development
Slim.js is a lightning fast library for development of native web-components and custom-elements based modern applications. No black magic involved.
It uses es6+DOM native API and boosts up HTML elements with superpowers. 

### Is this another framework?
Nope. It's a slim code layer that adds framework-like power to your custom elements, using only the browser's native capabilities.
Here's what you get:
- Automatic rendering using templates
- One-way data binding, derived from templates
- It can be extended: Anyone can add custom plugins or directives
- It feels like a framework (in a good way), but it's not limiting you to work with any.
- It's as small as 3.4 KBytes (gzipped)!
- Single file for core functionality, and your'e good to go.
- No tools required, everything is based on native browser API. Choose your own tools.
- (Optional) Decorators for es-next syntax, via babel
- Works with mixins from other libraries, such as Polymer

## Standards compilant
- es6
- web-components V1
- no transpiling or compilation required

## Tools free
